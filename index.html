        <!-- we can use this interpolation syntax to render properties from our vue data
        this will convert all type if data to string and render on screen -->
        <p>{{ greet }}</p>

        <!-- 4 -->
        <!-- now you need to know that the interpolation syntax will only work between
        opening and closing brackets where you want show html content
        many times we also have to provide dynamic property to html attributes as well
        so for that we use v-bind: directive which will bind data property to html attribute
        and we can use v-bind to almost all html attributes -->
        <a v-bind:href="vueDoc"> Go to Doc.</a>

        <!-- 5 -->
        <!-- now it is important to understand that in interpolation and v-bind you are not just
        limited to use data properties only you can also use any simple javascript 
        expression   -->
        <p> {{ 1 + 1 }} </p>
        <p> {{ Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'greater' : 'small' }} </p>

        <!-- as you can see we can also use js expressions in v-bind and keep in 
        mind that this v-bind sony need something as string so that it can use
        it as property value hear our expression will return string so it's ok -->
        <a v-bind:href="Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'greater' : 'small'"> link </a>

        <!-- hear we are using v-bind but using static data so it need as string
        so we will also quote it in '' so it will be string -->
        <a v-bind:href="'hiii'"> link 2</a>

        <!-- because we use any js expression in this we also can call methods like that -->
        <p> {{ randomString() }} </p>



        <p> counter is {{ counter }} </p>

        <p> inline js </p>
        <!-- 7 -->
        <!-- as like data binding we can also bind events to elements for that we have to
        use another directive which is v-on: and then event name we want to listen  
        the v-on can also able to parse js expressions so we can use small js expressions
        hear and can also point to methods in our vue object. and we can listen to all
        possible events by v-on-->
        <button v-on:click="counter++">Add</button>
        <button v-on:click="counter--">Reduce</button>

        <!-- you can see hear that we can pass value to a method as well like this
        and also if we don't want to pass any value we can just use method name
        without () it will also work fine also you can use () if you don't want to pass
        anything as well -->
        <p> in method </p>
        <button v-on:click="addOrReduce('add')">Add</button>
        <button v-on:click="addOrReduce('reduce')">Reduce</button> <br><br>

        <!-- NOTE: using {{}}  and v-bind is call data binding because we bind our
        html element to value we have in our vue object. and using v-on is call 
        event binding because we are binding element with some event and when that
    `   event will occur define task in v-on will done -->

        <!-- 8 -->
        <!-- <input type="text" v-on:input="changeMyName" /> -->
        <!-- sometimes it also happen that we have to pass something with event
        so to do that we can use built in variable provide by vue $event and pass other params also -->
        <input type="text" v-on:input="changeMyName($event)" />
        <p> my name : {{ myName }} </p>

        <!-- 9 -->
        <!-- there are also some event modifiers available on events we can use then to change
        the behavior of an event. not all type of event modifiers are available on 
        events but you can use many useful of then and a full list is available on
        vue3 official docs
        the syntax of event modifier is v-on:<event_name>.<modifier_name>  -->
        <button v-on:click.right="clickBtn"> right click</button>

        <!-- 10 -->
        <!-- in our template some times we want that dynamic property which we bind
        only change once and then it stays same in template weather it's change in
        data or not we can use v-once directive -->
        <p v-once> counter value will stays initial : {{ counter }} </p>

        <!-- 11 -->
        <!-- many times in our code it also happens that in a input field we want
        to change our data property when we input something and also when that data
        property change in our code we want our input value to be updated as well
        for that we can use v-on:input for listen to input value change event and updated
        our data and for detect changes on data property and update we can bind 
        our input field value with data property with v-bind:value -->
        <input type="text" v-on:input="updateInputValue" v-bind:value="inputOne">
        <p> {{ inputOne }} </p>

        <!-- this is vary common task in vue js to bind input value with data in a way
        that if changes happen in data template side or in code side we want ro update
        it on both actual value and on template as well and this is called tow way binding
        for achieve more simply vue offer use built in directive called v-model 
        this will only need name of data and it will listen both changes and update data
        both side so we don't need to create different function to listen changes and no need
        to bind data by our self-->
        <input type="text" v-model="inputTwo">
        <p> {{ inputTwo }} </p>

        <!-- 12 -->
        <!-- vary imp -->
        <!--  -->
        <!-- notice one thing in code when we click to add or reduce counter buttons
        we can see that randomString() and all places where we use Math.random() is also
        rendering we can see that every time small and grater changes so those functions
        are rendering every time something changes  and it's not a issue with Math
        library it will happen in simple method as well -->

        {{ detectChange() }}

        <!-- as you can tell by console that every time we increase counter or type
        something in input fields we can see new console and you can clearly see that
        detectChange() and math function don't have any relation with counter or input
        data property so they should not change right?  -->

        <!-- what is happening hear is that when vue find some data property we use in 
        template is updated it re render only that value in dom but when we use direct
        functions in template then vue don't know on which property change it should
        re render that function so every time when some small thing updated vue will
        also re render all functions which we use on {{}} and data binding like v-bind
        it will not be the case for event binding because vue knows that on which 
        event it should call that function. so you can see hear all places where we
        use functions for data binding all those functions are re rendering and 
        this can be big performance because all those type of functions will re execute
        on every small change-->

        <!-- so moral of the story is you should avoid using direct functions for 
        data bindings like in {{}} and in v-bind and v-html etc-->

        <!-- so for those kind of situation where we have to use methods in data 
        binding we can use another feature provided by vue which we will learn next -->
