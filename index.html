        <!-- we can use this interpolation syntax to render properties from our vue data
        this will convert all type if data to string and render on screen -->
        <p>{{ greet }}</p>

        <!-- 4 -->
        <!-- now you need to know that the interpolation syntax will only work between
        opening and closing brackets where you want show html content
        many times we also have to provide dynamic property to html attributes as well
        so for that we use v-bind: directive which will bind data property to html attribute
        and we can use v-bind to almost all html attributes -->
        <a v-bind:href="vueDoc"> Go to Doc.</a>

        <!-- 5 -->
        <!-- now it is important to understand that in interpolation and v-bind you are not just
        limited to use data properties only you can also use any simple javascript 
        expression   -->
        <p> {{ 1 + 1 }} </p>
        <p> {{ Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'greater' : 'small' }} </p>

        <!-- as you can see we can also use js expressions in v-bind and keep in 
        mind that this v-bind sony need something as string so that it can use
        it as property value hear our expression will return string so it's ok -->
        <a v-bind:href="Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'greater' : 'small'"> link </a>

        <!-- hear we are using v-bind but using static data so it need as string
        so we will also quote it in '' so it will be string -->
        <a v-bind:href="'hiii'"> link 2</a>

        <!-- because we use any js expression in this we also can call methods like that -->

        <!-- 7 -->
        <!-- as like data binding we can also bind events to elements for that we have to
        use another directive which is v-on: and then event name we want to listen  
        the v-on can also able to parse js expressions so we can use small js expressions
        hear and can also point to methods in our vue object. and we can listen to all
        possible events by v-on-->
        <button v-on:click="counter++">Add</button>
        <button v-on:click="counter--">Reduce</button>

        <!-- you can see hear that we can pass value to a method as well like this
        and also if we don't want to pass any value we can just use method name
        without () it will also work fine also you can use () if you don't want to pass
        anything as well -->
        <p> in method </p>

        <button v-on:click="addOrReduce('reduce')">Reduce</button> <br><br>

        <!-- NOTE: using {{}}  and v-bind is call data binding because we bind our
        html element to value we have in our vue object. and using v-on is call 
        event binding because we are binding element with some event and when that
    `   event will occur define task in v-on will done -->

        <!-- 8 -->
        <!-- <input type="text" v-on:input="changeMyName" /> -->
        <!-- sometimes it also happen that we have to pass something with event
        so to do that we can use built in variable provide by vue $event and pass other params also -->
